Visualization and analysis of the numbers of the coronavirus cases in Mainland China and around the world.
* Dataset (compiled by John Hopkins University) -- https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
* Dashboard (from JHU) -- https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

A web app of the notebook can be accessed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Physicist91/covid19/blob/master/covid-19-analysis.ipynb).
I have also used the cleaned dataset hosted on Kaggle -- https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report, as well as the public kernels associated with them.
